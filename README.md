## How to Play

1. When you start the game, you'll be asked to pick a difficulty level:
   - **Easy**: You get 10 attempts to guess the number.
   - **Hard**: You get only 5 attempts.

2. Enter your guess, and the game will tell you if it's **too high** or **too low**.
3. Keep guessing until you find the correct number or run out of attempts.
4. When the game ends, youâ€™ll have the option to play again if you want.

## Features

- **Random Number Generation**: The game picks a new number each time you play, so itâ€™s different every round.
- **Difficulty Levels**: Choose between *Easy* and *Hard* modes, with different numbers of attempts.
- **Replay Option**: You can keep playing as many times as you want by choosing to play again at the end.

## Getting Started

Before running the game, make sure you have Python installed. You can check if Python is installed by typing `python --version` in your terminal or command prompt.

This game also uses some external images/logos (like `logo`, `you_lose_logo`, and `logo_end`) to make it more fun, which are assumed to be in an `art` module. Make sure you have the `art.py` file if you want the logos to display.

## Code Structure

- **`play_easy()`**: This function runs the game in easy mode with 10 guesses.
- **`play_hard()`**: This function runs the game in hard mode with 5 guesses.
- **`play_game(user_difficulty)`**: This function selects which difficulty mode to start based on your choice.
- **`random_number`**: A new random number between 1 and 100 is generated each time the game starts.
- **Main Game Loop**: After each game, youâ€™re asked if you want to play again, and the game restarts if you choose to.

## How to Run the Game

1. Save this code in a Python file, for example, `number_guessing_game.py`.
2. In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the folder where you saved the file.
3. Run the game by typing:
   ```bash
   python number_guessing_game.py

When you start the game, the following message will appear:
```

```

- If you choose **easy**, you will have 10 attempts.
- If you choose **hard**, you will have 5 attempts.

Each time you make a guess, youâ€™ll get feedback like "Too Low" or "Too High" until you find the correct answer or run out of guesses.
